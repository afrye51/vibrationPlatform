Start a serial connection, with a baud rate of 9600
Send one of 5 modes with:
	Each message is a String
	The first parameter is the mode
	All parameters are integers, separated by commas
	Each line is terminated by a Capital 'Q'

(1) Stop - Sets all motors to motor power 0
	Message: "1Q"
	ex: "1Q"
(2) Individual - Pass in motor (0-3), motor power
	Message: "2,[motor number 0-3],[motor power 0-255]Q"
	ex: "2,0,90Q"
(3) All - Pass in motor power
	Message: "3,[motor power 0-255]Q"
	ex: "3,80Q"
(4) Direction - Pass in angle (in degrees) and motor power
	Message: "4,[angle in degrees 0-360],[motor power 0-255]Q"
	ex: "4,135,60Q"
(5) Steps - Pass in angle and motor power
	Message: "5,[angle in degrees 0-360],[motor power 0-255]Q"
	ex: "5,45,70Q"
